### Topics:
- Build Flexible Collections with Arrays :strawberry: 
> There are a data structure fo save collection of data call it array use [] brackets instead {}, Arrays are a kind of special type of objects, ant that means instead of provider a key arrays do it itself.

- Check Element Existence in Arrays :heavy_check_mark:
> there are many ways to chek if our array have a particular item

- transform Arrays with reduce :red_circle: 
> As developers sometimes when we work with arrays, we don't want to iterate or do some operation in every element inside the array, fortunately we have a method called reduce that allow us transform elements of array in something useful.

- Avoid Mutations with Array Spreed
> The push Method mutates the original array. We can fix this by using a non-mutating array method such as concat.
> Alternatively, we can use the array spread operator(...) to clone the previous array.

- Mold Arrays with the Spread Operator
we can merge multiple arrays into a new array using the spread operator **...** The order in which the arrays are entered is retained.
